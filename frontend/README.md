## McHacks 12 - CliniQ

Developed CliniQ, an all-in-one application that let's patients describe their
symptoms and provides them with estimated wait time until their admission, which
means they can wait in the comfort of their own homes. Along with that, clinics
are able to receive the patient information and the app automatically prioritizes 
them in terms of severity of symptoms and wait time. When they are ready to receive 
them, they can send out emails with the push of a button that let's the patient know
they will have a spot open for them soon and they should make their way to the clinic.
